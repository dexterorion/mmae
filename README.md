This project aims to develop some useful tools to help teams start a new microservices architecture without the cost of creating all the first configurations.

## Introduction
Starting a new microservices architecture is not easy. You need to think about client/service and service/service communications, CI/CD, project structures, fault tolerance and lots of other issues.

MMAE is a project that helps the software architect/developers start brand new microservice architecture, without the cost of thinking about the best tools. 

The intent is not to force the use of a single technology in each case (like API Gateway, service mesh, programming language and so on). The idea is to have some tools (one for each need) to help with a quick start, then letting the developers/architect to define the next steps after.
